# Python-Brian
# This is a open workspace for learning and collaboration for beginners to learn the Python programming language.
1. Python can be downloaded straight from the website: https://www.python.org/ please choose a newer 3. version
2. Feel free to upload your .py file to this workspace. I'll be uploading most of my newbie files as I learn.
3. Pull requests are for creating branches where you make edits to existing files. These branches can be merged to the master branch later    on.
4. Feel free to add other files to this workspace - I've added a bath bombs recipe I wrote down a while ago for laughs.
5. That's all folks.
